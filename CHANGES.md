## Benefits of These Changes

- **More Reliable Installation:** Better path handling and detection methods
- **Easier Troubleshooting:** Verification tools and improved error messages
- **Clearer Documentation:** Step-by-step guide and troubleshooting solutions
- **Consistent Behavior:** Works correctly regardless of installation location

## How to Apply These Updates

If you already have a previous installation:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Run the verification script to ensure everything is set up correctly:
   - macOS/Linux: `./scripts/verify-installation.sh`
   - Windows: `scripts\verify-installation.bat`
3. If verification fails, follow the suggested fixes or refer to the `INSTALL.md` guide

For new installations, simply follow the instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file.
