## Notes on Recent Improvements
- Completed full integration with Claude Desktop on macOS
- Claude Desktop now has full feature parity with Cursor on macOS
- Implementation uses properly configured environment variables for Resolve API access
- Configuration includes proper paths to Resolve scripting libraries and modules

## Development Priorities Update

1. **Current Focus**:
   - ✅ Complete Claude Desktop functionality on macOS
   - 🔄 Improve error handling for API calls
   - 🔄 Expand media pool and color page operations

2. **Next Steps**:
   - 🔄 Develop comprehensive error reporting
   - 🟡 Implement more advanced timeline editing operations
   - 🟡 Add support for Fusion page functionality

3. **Future Work**:
   - 🟡 Windows support expansion
   - 🟡 Implement missing API functions
   - 🟡 Enhance cross-platform compatibility

## Implementation Notes

- **Direct JSON-RPC**: Using a custom JSON-RPC server that directly communicates with DaVinci Resolve's API
- **Project Management**: Using ProjectManager API with proper error handling for non-existent projects
- **Timeline Operations**: Most timeline functions work reliably with the direct API binding
- **Media Pool**: Operations are working well for basic functions
- **Integration Methods**:
  - Global config: Using .cursor/mcp.json for system-wide configuration
  - Project-specific config: Using project-level mcp.json for project-specific settings
  - Claude Desktop: Using claude_desktop_config.json for Claude desktop integration
- **Startup Scripts**:
  - `run-direct-server.sh`: Basic script to launch the JSON-RPC server
  - `mcp_resolve-cursor_start`: Enhanced startup script with environment validation, Resolve running check, and better error reporting

## Testing Procedure

For each feature, testing involves:
1. Direct API testing with test scripts
2. Testing via Cursor AI interface
3. Verification in DaVinci Resolve UI that actions were performed
4. Cross-checking results for accuracy

Features are marked as "✅ Implemented and tested" only after all steps are completed successfully.
