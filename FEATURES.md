- **Timeline Operations**: Most timeline functions work reliably with the direct API binding
- **Media Pool**: Operations are working well for basic functions
- **Integration Methods**:
  - Global config: Using .cursor/mcp.json for system-wide configuration
  - Project-specific config: Using project-level mcp.json for project-specific settings
  - Claude Desktop: Using claude_desktop_config.json for Claude desktop integration
  - Windows-specific templates: New platform-specific templates in config-templates directory
- **Startup Scripts**:
  - `run-direct-server.sh`: Basic script to launch the JSON-RPC server on macOS
  - `run-now.bat`: Enhanced Windows batch file for launching server with improved compatibility
  - `mcp_resolve-cursor_start`: Enhanced startup script with environment validation, Resolve running check, and better error reporting
  - `mcp_resolve-claude_start`: Dedicated startup script for Claude Desktop integration
  - `mcp_resolve_launcher.sh`: Universal launcher that provides an interactive menu and command-line options to:
    - Start/stop Cursor MCP server
    - Start/stop Claude Desktop MCP server
    - Start/stop both servers simultaneously
    - Check server status
    - Start servers with specific DaVinci Resolve projects
    - Force server startup when DaVinci Resolve process isn't detected
- **Platform Support**:
  - macOS: Fully supported and tested
  - Windows: Improved experimental support with platform-specific path detection
  - Linux: Not currently implemented but framework in place for future support

## Testing Procedure

For each feature, testing involves:
1. Direct API testing with test scripts
2. Testing via Cursor AI interface
3. Verification in DaVinci Resolve UI that actions were performed
4. Cross-checking results for accuracy

Features are marked as "✅ Implemented and tested" only after all steps are completed successfully. 
Windows features are currently marked as "⚠️ Implemented but needs testing" as they require more field testing with the enhanced Windows support.
